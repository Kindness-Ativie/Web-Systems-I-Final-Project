      <p>It's a new stage of thinking. <br> It's a new stage of education. <br> It's a new stage for our youth. <br> In summary, it's the kindest thing we could do for our youth today.</p> </div>

      <h1 class=whiteheader>Why stages?</h1>
      <p> Stages are temporary. Stages have successors. Even in our progression, we cannot cease to improve. This is stage kindness. It's an act of kindness to our distracted youth: the backbones of our future. It is also a physical stage for our brilliant, young minds to share their work. My wish is that after stage kindness our society does not stay stagnant. My wish is that more brilliant stages are to come. </p>

        <p>"They do not allow children to play with their toys for eternity. They understand they must hide their eyes from frivolities and distractions and brace the world. However, we have built a toy stripped of the youthful bells and whistles with infinite possibilities and plays. We do not classify it as a toy, however, once we bestow it its proper name, a blinding, vacuous black hole in improper doses, we will lift our eyes and brace the world.‚Äù -Kindness Ativie on social media in society</p>

          <p>"I believe the only thing that prevents world changers from sprinting forth and blossoming is perspective. Once you acknowledge that those who climbed to power from the fruits of their own labor, are no more or less human than you, you are empowered. All have gifts bestowed upon them, however, the success that blessed a nation is feared, ominous, and intimidating. If success was treated with the same viability as normalcy, so few would not hold so much power. Believe from the womb that this is destiny, like a rain cloud passing overhead or the sun rising again, and you will do as you please." -Kindness Ativie on the potential of our youth</p>
